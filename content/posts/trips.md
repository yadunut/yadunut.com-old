As part of our schools FP3 module, we had the opportunity to go on visits to different institutions and companies. I had the wonderful oppotunity to visit SUTD and DSTA

## SUTD

W learnt about the different programs offered in SUTD. SUTD is different from other universities as their curriculum incorporates stuff from non tech related topics. This allows their graduates to have a wider understanding of the field and know the different aspects of the business. To give us an understandingon how the classes went, we had a trial class on which they taught us Rainbow Tables. Learning about that was very interesting as I hadn't thought of space constraints of rainbow tables. Learning about precomputed hash chains was fascinating


## DSTA

This was a visit to DSTA organised by NP. DSTA was very interesting, manly their C3 Development team. DSTA showed us what different sectors of their company does, from mobile development for secure apps, to building custom software platforms for the other sectors of the government. The sector which caught my eye was C3, which built tools and platforms for parts of the military and navy. The unique challenges they faced caught my eye and piqued my interest in them.
