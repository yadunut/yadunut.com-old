      <description>As part of our schools FP3 module, we had the opportunity to go on visits to different institutions and companies. I had the wonderful oppotunity to visit SUTD and DSTA
SUTD W learnt about the different programs offered in SUTD. SUTD is different from other universities as their curriculum incorporates stuff from non tech related topics. This allows their graduates to have a wider understanding of the field and know the different aspects of the business.</description>
